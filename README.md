# Cryptotrader - Cryptocurrency Trader Agent and Agent Development Environment

THIS REPOSITORY IS IN DEVELOPMENT STAGE, SO THE PREREQUISITES, DOCUMENTATION AND NOTEBOOKS ARE OFTEN OUTDATED!
IF YOU MISS SOME PRE REQUISITE, IT IS PROBABLY MISSING, SO JUST INSTALL IT BY HAND.
CONTRIBUTIONS ARE VERY WELCOME!

This repository contains infra-structure for agent backtesting and cryptocoin trading.
Currently it supports backtesting and papertrading using poloniex's historical dada and also live trading at poloniex.
We are, however, not associated or affiliated anyhow with poloniex or any services that it provides.
It is under active development and is provided "AS-IS", without any warrants whatsoever.

You just need to run it under an active internet connection, as the data will be downloaded on the go.
